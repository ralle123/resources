## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
where9am <- read_csv("https://assets.datacamp.com/production/course_2906/datasets/locations.csv")
#where9am <- read_csv("where9am.csv")
head(where9am)
```

## calculating naive bayes

P(A | B) = \frac{P(A\, {\rm and}\, B)}{P(B)}

```{r , echo=FALSE}
# Compute P(A) 
p_A <- nrow(subset(where9am,location=="office"))/nrow(where9am)
p_A
# Compute P(B)
p_B <- nrow(subset(where9am,daytype=="weekday"))/nrow(where9am)

# Compute the observed P(A and B)
p_AB <- nrow(subset(where9am,location=="office" & daytype=="weekday"))/nrow(where9am)

# Compute P(A | B) and print its value
p_A_given_B <- p_AB / p_B

p_A_given_B
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r, results='hide'}

thursday9am <- where9am %>%
  filter(weekday == "thursday") 

saturday9am <- where9am %>%
  filter(weekday == "saturday")

# Load the naivebayes package
#install.packages("naivebayes")
library(naivebayes)

# Build the location prediction model
locmodel <- naive_bayes(location ~ daytype, data = where9am)

# Predict Thursday's 9am location
predict(locmodel, thursday9am)

# Predict Saturdays's 9am location
predict(locmodel, saturday9am)

locmodel
# Obtain the predicted probabilities for Thursday at 9am
predict(locmodel, thursday9am , type = "prob")
# Obtain the predicted probabilities for Saturday at 9am
predict(locmodel, saturday9am, type = "prob")
```
```{r}
locations <- location

weekday_afternoon <- locations %>%
  filter(daytype == "weekday", hourtype == "afternoon")

weekday_evening <- locations %>%
  filter(daytype == "weekday", hourtype == "evening")
```
